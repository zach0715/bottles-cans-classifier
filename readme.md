# Project Name

 Add short description of project here > This model is a bottle can classifier that helps tell you whether you are looking at a bottle or a can.  This classifer could be used in real life when you need to throw something away, but you don't know whether to throw it in a bottle receptacle or a can receptacle, which would help with items getting put in the wrong bins.
